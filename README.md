## Overview

OCR is a versatile developer tool that facilitates the infomration extraction from images through Optical Character Recognition, enabling seamless conversion of visual data into editable, searchable test.
It is especially for processing invoices, providing structured JSON outputs that capture key-value pair varying formats and structures.

### Why OCR?

This project empowers developers to automate data digitization and integration workflows. The core features includes:

- **Text Extraction:** Converts images of printed or handwritten content into machine-readable test.
- **Structured Data Output:** Produces JSON representations of invoice details for easy integration.
- **Workflow Automation:** Utilizes Jupyter Notebook to orchestrate end-to-end processing pipelines.
- **Validation & Accuracy:** Supports ground truth comparison to ensure high-quality data extraction.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project requires the following dependencies;\
**Programming Language:** Jupyter Notebook

### Installation

Build OCR from the source and install dependencies:

1. Clone the repository:

   > git clone https://github.com/SaubhagyaMaharjan/OCR

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   > cd OCR

save the model
fine tune in the previous dataset
ppt slide for 5 minutes
start streamlit with proper folder structure
a folder/notebook with these ipynbs
UV for package management, similar as pip..
pre commit hooks
gitignore

Title: Information Extraction from Invoices

Description: This project aims to develop an automated information extraction system that uses AI and OCR technologies to parse and extract key-value pairs and tabular data from invoices of varying formats and structures.

Dataset: here

The input to the system will be invoice image and the output must be in JSON. The JSON shema is defined in the ground truth of dataset.

Develop a clean and simple UI with streamlit to show the system demo.
